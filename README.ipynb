    "---\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a software pipeline to identify vehicles in a video from a front-facing camera on a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project includes following procedures:\n",
    "* Perform a [Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_hog.html) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier\n",
    "* Apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector (optionally).\n",
    "* Normalize extracted features and randomize a selection for training and testing.\n",
    "* Implement a sliding-window technique and use the trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.\n",
    "* Run the pipeline on a video stream (start with the [test_video.mp4](test_video.mp4) and later implement on full [project_video.mp4](project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
    "* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detail witeup of the projects can be found in [writeup_report.md](writeup_report.md) document."
